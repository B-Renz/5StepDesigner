HTML / CSS Project from The Odin Project

This project is intending to highlight more on the UI (design) 
portion of the front-end development of websites

The project doesn't specify whether or not to design with varied medias in mind
but I think it's best practice to at least include 4 different medias:
1. Mobile Viewing
2. Tablet Viewing
3. Laptop Viewing
4. Desktop-Monitor/TV Viewing

So, I've decided to do this for any website I make 
(whether it be for my protfolio, for fun, or for work)
which is pretty easy using Google Developer Tools when 
working in Live Preview in VSCode
